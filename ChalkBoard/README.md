## ## Website features:

## These images display the site map (Image 1) and wireframe (Images 2-8) of our future distance-learning website "Chalkboard." 
The purpose of our website is to allow both students and teachers to learn and teach virtually. 
Before entering the main pages, users aka Student or Instructor must enter their username and password through the signup/signin page (Image 3).
Both Student and Instructor may view their course home page (Image 5), in which 
they can view their syllabus, textbook, lecture materials, and assignments.
Instructors have additional features in their pages where they can assign work, 
grade, and submit lectures. Students may save drafts/submit their assignments/lectures
which can instructors assign and grade (Image 4). 
Profile settings can also be changed, such as password and username (Image 2).
Students may add or drop a course, and Instructors can add or delete courses, 
add instructors to their courses, or remove themselves from a course (Image 7). --Hafsah Kamal

###### What we learned:
11/02-03/2021
"I specifically learned a lot about git due to Rupakshi. Some keywords include "git branch", "git checkout -b <name>", and in general "git status" to check the changes of my repositories (in the origin and local repo). I also struggled in finding a way to edit HTML text for the "TeacherCreatingTest" page, because I did not even realize text could be editable after being placed in the DOM tree, so that was fascinating, realizing that text could be manipulated using basic HTML.
  Rupakshi and I also discussed using Bootstrap to add our styles and make our webpages reponsive so we did so by copy-pasting our <head> tags in each of our HTML files, but I think we will just import our necessary stylesheets and scripts next time.
  One thing I've also learned is that we have a long way to go. Just these few pages took more than 6-8 hours for me, so I know we need to put in our utmost effort to create an end result that we are proud to display."
