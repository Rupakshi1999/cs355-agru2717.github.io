These images display the site map (Image 1) and wireframe (Images 2-8) of our future distance-learning website "Chalkboard." 
The purpose of our website is to allow both students and teachers to learn and teach virtually. 
Before entering the main pages, users aka Student or Instructor must enter their username and password through the signup/signin page (Image 3).
Both Student and Instructor may view their course home page (Image 5), in which 
they can view their syllabus, textbook, lecture materials, and assignments.
Instructors have additional features in their pages where they can assign work, 
grade, and submit lectures. Students may save drafts/submit their assignments/lectures
which can instructors assign and grade (Image 4). 
Profile settings can also be changed, such as password and username (Image 2).
Students may add or drop a course, and Instructors can add or delete courses, 
add instructors to their courses, or remove themselves from a course (Image 7). --Hafsah Kamal
